3. Use tools like grep, tail, and less for efficient log analysis
4. Understand log patterns for quick problem identification
5. Correlate logs from different sources when troubleshooting
6. Maintain log retention policies for compliance
7. Use log monitoring tools for proactive issue detection

These logs are essential tools for maintaining system health, security, and performance in an AMS environment.
